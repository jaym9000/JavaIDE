# Java IDE
 In this project, some friends and I created our own Java IDE using JavaFX for our UI.\
 This Java IDE was a collaborative project with 2 other partners and  the objective was to be able to create files, save files and to be able to compile these files whilst catching errors if there are any.\
 You are also able to add files from your directory into the IDE and save them.
 
 *Make sure to successfully compile all files before running the main file*
